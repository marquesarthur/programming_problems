# Use Hashing:
# Traverse the list one by one and keep putting the node addresses in a Hash Table.
# At any point, if NULL is reached then return false and if next of current node points to any of the previously stored nodes in Hash then return true.

# Mark Visited Nodes:
# This solution requires modifications to basic linked list data structure.  Have a visited flag with each node.  Traverse the linked list and keep marking visited nodes.  If you see a visited node again then there is a loop. This solution works in O(n) but requires additional information with each node.
# A variation of this solution that doesnâ€™t require modification to basic data structure can be implemented using hash.  Just store the addresses of visited nodes in a hash and if you see an address that already exists in hash then there is a loop.
